I created simple app with react, for styling I used "styled-components", for date i used "date-fns".
App is responsive and compliant with the guidelines. 

possible improve:
-> use GraphQL for API call, IMO this would enable easier and more efficient database queries
-> add Theme for styles,
-> adding TypeScript to the project
-> creating loaders
-> adding a notification system for the user to make the bug from the database display nicely as a toast at the top of the page
-> remembering selected filters by the user
-> add tests
